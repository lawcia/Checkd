# Checkd

## Getting started:

1) get a local copy of the project

`git clone https://github.com/meganjohn/Checkd.git`

2) In the root directory, install the project dependencies by typing this command in the terminal. This command should create a folder called node_modules. 

`npm install`

3) In the root directory create a .env file to store the environment variables, and assign API_KEY_BI to your api key. Get the political bias API key from [bipartisian](https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/political-bias-api-and-integrations/).

```API_KEY_BI=your api key```

4) Now you can build the react project and start the express development server. This command should create a folder called build. 

`npm run dev`

5) The website will now be running on http://localhost:5000
